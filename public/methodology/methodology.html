				<p>
					This site contains programmatically-generated campaign contribution
					data for each of Georgia's sitting state senators. A list of sitting
					Georgia state senators is generated by scraping (see About page for
					more info) the
					<a
						href="http://www.senate.ga.gov/senators/en-US/SenateMembersList.aspx"
						target="_blank"
						>Georgia State Senate website</a
					>.Then, each senator's contribution data is scraped from the
					<a
						href="http://media.ethics.ga.gov/search/Campaign/Campaign_ByName.aspx"
						target="_blank"
						>Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission
						website</a
					>, and some various datapoints are calculated (see below).
				</p>
				<p>
					Senators are sorted by last name alphabetical order. Vacant seats are
					not included.
				</p>
				<h3>Total cash and in-kind contributions:</h3>
				<p>
					Sum of itemized cash contributions and itemized in-kind contributions
					raised throughout the politician's state senate career. Only
					tracked/qualifying reports are counted (see below). Only contributions
					raised for the office of Georgia State Senate are included, no other
					contributions raised for other races are included.
				</p>
				<p>
					An in-kind contribution is a product or service rendered to the
					senator that has been ascribed a cash value by the reporting entity
					(for example, 'campaign signs' valued at $750).
				</p>
				<p>
					Non-itemized contributions are not counted. Non-itemized contributions
					are less than $100 each, and are generally a small minority of total
					contributions.
				</p>
				<h3>Tracked reports:</h3>
				<p>
					The sum of cash contributions and in-kind contributions raised by the
					politician for each qualifying report during their state senate
					career.
				</p>
				<p>
					A qualifying report is the most recently-amended version of that
					report. Amended reports contain all the same contributions reported in
					the original report (plus any changes), so the original report is
					ignored. Reports are sometimes amended more than once; in which case,
					only the most recently-amended version is used.
				</p>
				<h3>Top contributors:</h3>
				<p>
					Each itemized contribution comes from a named contributor. This is
					usually an individual, Political Action Committee (PAC), business, or
					another politician's campaign (for example, 'The Comittee to Elect
					Butch Miller'). Each unique named contributor is recorded, and all
					their contributions made to the politician in question over the course
					of their state senate career are summed. The resulting array is sorted
					highest to lowest, and the top 30 contributors are shown.
				</p>
				<h3>Last updated:</h3>
				<p>
					The date and time that the senator's data was scraped. Scraping is
					done via node.js app (see About tab for more info) that must be
					manually run in order to update the data. Reports filed after 'last
					updated' are not included in the senator's dataset.
				</p>
				<p>
					Occassionally, errors occur during scraping (poor internet connection,
					etc). If this happens, the app checks to see if the senator already
					has a good dataset; if they do, then the data is not overwritten. If
					you observe that different senators have different 'last updated'
					dates, this is likely the reason.
