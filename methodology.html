			<h1>Methodology</h1>
			<p>
				This site contains programmatically-generated campaign contribution data
				for each of Georgia's sitting state senators. A list of sitting Georgia
				state senators is generated by scraping (see About page for more info)
				the Georgia State Senate website:
				http://www.senate.ga.gov/senators/en-US/SenateMembersList.aspx . Then,
				each senator's contribution data is scraped from the Georgia Government
				Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission website:
				http://media.ethics.ga.gov/search/Campaign/Campaign_ByName.aspx , and
				some various datapoints are calculated (see below).
			</p>
			<p>
				Senators are sorted by last name alphabetical order. Vacant seats are
				not included.
			</p>
			<h3>Total cash and in-kind contributions:</h3>
			<p>
				Sum of itemized cash contributions and itemized in-kind contributions
				raised throughout the politician's state senate career. Only
				tracked/qualifying reports are counted (see below). Only contributions
				raised for the office of Georgia State Senate are included, no other
				contributions raised for other races are included.
			</p>
			<p>
				An in-kind contribution is a product or service rendered to the senator
				that has been ascribed a cash value by the reporting entity (for
				example, 'campaign signs' valued at $750).
			</p>
			<p>
				Non-itemized contributions are not counted. Non-itemized contributions
				are less than $100 each, and are generally a small minority of total
				contributions.
			</p>
			<h3>Tracked reports:</h3>
			<p>
				The sum of cash contributions and in-kind contributions raised by the
				politician for each qualifying report during their state senate career.
			</p>
			<p>
				A qualifying report is the most recently-amended version of that report.
				Amended reports contain all the same contributions reported in the
				original report (plus any changes), so the original report is ignored.
				Reports are sometimes amended more than once; in which case, only the
				most recently-amended version is used.
			</p>
			<h3>Top contributors:</h3>
			<p>
				Each itemized contribution comes from a named contributor. This is
				usually an individual, Political Action Committee (PAC), business, or
				another politician's campaign (for example, 'The Comittee to Elect Butch
				Miller'). Each unique named contributor is recorded, and all their
				contributions made to the politician in question over the course of
				their state senate career are summed. The resulting array is sorted
				highest to lowest, and the top 30 contributors are shown.
			</p>
			<h3>Last updated:</h3>
			<p>
				The date and time that the senator's data was scraped. Scraping is done
				via node.js app (see About tab for more info) that must be manually run
				in order to update the data. Reports filed after 'last updated' are not
				included in the senator's dataset.
			</p>
			<p>
				Occassionally, errors occur during scraping (poor internet connection,
				etc). If this happens, the app checks to see if the senator already has
				a good dataset; if they do, then the data is not overwritten. If you
				observe that different senators have different 'last updated' dates,
				this is likely the reason.
